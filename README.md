# Robotic voice synthesizer
This project was created for my Embedded Systems course. The app applies robotic voice effect to the input audio in real time and outputs the changed voice. It's meant to be run on Raspberry Pi or similar hardware, so it's optimized for low-end computers. For detailed description please see the documentation file (in Polish).
